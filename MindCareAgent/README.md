## Voice
In the beginning, I tried to use TTS, but Groq does not support TTS. The second option was to use gTTS for Groq, but my choice was pyttsx3 because it is simpler, and I can change the voice speed more easily. Another reason is that gTTS requires an internet connection, but I want to switch to a better voice in the future.

## How It Works
To activate the MindCareAgent, simply press **Ctrl**. This shortcut triggers the AI agent, allowing it to assist you with information about anxiety attacks, their factors, symptoms, and severity.
